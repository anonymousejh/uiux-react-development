# Describe the goal of the application and value to a user
The goal of my application is for family members to buy cars for the entire family when moving to a new country or state. This might be helpful for balancing budgets all in one application - as current car dealership websites are confusing and make it difficult to compare prices especially when purchasing multiple used cars.

# Explain the organization of your Components, and the props and state related to them
I used components to create each card (representing one car). The props for the card component includes all necessary info relating to that car as well as a state array in order to keep track of what cars have been added to my fleet. I used ChakraUI for the buttons and drop down selectors. The main App contains the filters, sorters and the wrapper for all my cards.

# Note the usability principles considered for layout and hierarchy
I took a very neutral color scheme apporach to ensure that the website is easily accessible and that the car and buttons are highly visibile. I also made sure that the website is responsive. I created a clear heirarchy with a top bar (with headers, aggregate info, filters and sort) and the lower content area.
